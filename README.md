## Why use the Knit MCP Server?

The Knit MCP Server is a developer productivity tool designed to accelerate the process of building SaaS integrations. By bridging Knit's comprehensive knowledge base with your IDE's AI, it eliminates context switching and hallucinations.

### 🚀 Key Benefits for Developers

* **Context-Aware Coding & Documentation**: The MCP Server exposes Knit's full API documentation and integration patterns to your AI assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude). Your AI doesn't just guess; it knows exactly how to write correct code for Knit's Unified APIs, webhooks, and syncs.
